# project

* create a simple div/card -- and put three images inside it and the size of images is 9:16 -- and inside this div - these three images will be displayed one by one -- like a swiper when user click then the image is changed --
* now the swaping should be done -- using the navigation button and swapping gesture - i guess it is for mobile phone -
* we need to put default text on each image.
* (1) now the text that we add on each iamge is dragable -- means user can move the text any where inside the boundry of image/div
* (2) try can we change the size of selected text -- like we see in the paint or any in case of image to increase/decrease its size..
* (3) now the user should be able to change the font-family, font-size , font-color, of the selected text
* (4) now there should be an option to create/add new text -- each time the user click it should create a new input box for text keep in mind only on the current --- selected image like image1,image2,image3 not on all the iamges.. and when user add the new text it also have same text feature like dragable , user can re-size, change the font-family , font-size etc. keep in mind that -- when the user click on add text first time and added some text and after that user click again on add text second time -- then our both text should be work independently -- means suppose on text1 we change the font size to 16 and on text 2 we change the font size to 40 px -- so it should be visible clearly in both that user can control both independently.

* **Note** *we can't use any other library framework other then swiper.js* ***we must use html,css, and js***
